Here again we explore various ways of thinking about division, and we use those to explain some difficult division situations, such as division involving zero.

There are many ways to think about division.  Here are three:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Division as multiplication}  I know that $42\div 6=7$ because $6\times 7=42$.  To figure this out, I asked myself what number could go in the box in $6\times \Box =42$.  In algebra, this is like solving the equation $6x=42$.

\item \textbf{Division as sharing}  To compute $42\div 6$, I can imagine sharing 42 cookies among 6 people, and I can see that each person would get 7 cookies. A more general way to ask the question is to ask, ``If 42 cookies are distributed equally across 6 groups, how many cookies are in one group?''  The answer is ``7 cookies are in one group" because 6 groups of 7 cookies each is 42 cookies in all.  

\item \textbf{Division as measurement}  To compute  $42\div 6$, I can imagine measuring 42 cookies into bags of 6 cookies each.  In other words, I can ask, ``If 42 cookies are distributed equally in groups of 6 cookies each, how many groups can be made?''  The answer is ``7 groups"  because 7 groups of 6 cookies each would be 42 cookies in all.   
\end{itemize}
