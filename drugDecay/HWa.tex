\begin{question}
A solution to a numeric equation is a $\answer[format=string]{number}$ that makes the equation true.  A solution to a differential equation is a $\answer[format=string]{function}$ that makes the equation true.

Pharmacokinetics is the study of the behavior of drugs and other substances administered to living organisms.  
The well-established general model for 
the elimination of a given drug from the body of a given human being is given by the differential equation 
$$y'(t)=-\frac{ky(t)}{A+y(t)}$$
where $y(0)$ is the initial concentration in, say, milligrams per liter, and $y(t)$ is the concentration at time $t$.  The constants $k$ and $A$ depend, of course, on the particular drug and the particular human being. 


\begin{question}
When the drug in question is alcohol, $y(t)$ is usually rather large in comparison to $A$.   With this assumption, we can approximate the general model with a simpler model, $y'(t)=\answer{-k}$.    

The general solution to this differential equation is 
\[  
y(t) =\answer{ -kt + C}, 
\]
where $C=y(0)$ the initial concentration at time $t=0$.  

What kind of function is this? $\answer[format=string]{linear}$
\end{question}


\begin{question}
When the drug in question is cocaine, $y(t)$ is usually very small in comparison to $A$.   With this assumption, we can approximate the general model with a simpler model, $y'(t)=\answer{-\frac{k}{A}}y(t)$.    

The general solution to this differential equation is 
\[  
y(t) =\answer{Ce^{-\frac{k}{A}t}}, 
\]
where $C=y(0)$ the initial concentration at time $t=0$.  

What kind of function is this? $\answer[format=string]{exponential}$
