Here we investigate what would happen if the Moon were as close as the
International Space Station.

Orbits of planets (and other things) in space basically follow paths
determined by conic sections. A conic section is a ``slice'' of a
cone. Currently, there is a space station orbiting the Earth at an average
altitude of $250$ kilometers.

\begin{question}
Put this distance into perspective by comparing this distance to
``landmarks'' on the Earth.
\begin{solution}
\begin{freeResponse}
Consider this, $250$ kilometers is around $155$ miles. Indianapolis,
Indiana is around $175$ miles away from Columbus, Ohio. On the other
hand, Lexington, Kentucky is almost exactly $155$ miles away as the
crow-flies and so are Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Detroit, Michigan.
\end{freeResponse}
