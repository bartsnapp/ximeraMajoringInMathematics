\begin{problem}
 During our last class, we came up with many interesting questions.   %Here are a few:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item How long would it take to go around the earth? 
%\item Would the objects rip each other apart? 
%\item Would it crash into the earth? 
%\item How much time would it take to get to the moon?
%\item How would the tides change because of the moon? 
%\item How long is the sun covered? 
%\item How much bigger will the moon look? 
%\item What speed would the moon have to be going to maintain a stable orbit? 
%\item Would the moon develop some kind of atmosphere? 
%\item Does the luminosity of the moon change? 
%%\item How long would it take to get to the moon? 
%%\item How would it change gravity on earth? 
%%\item What would happen to gravity between the two?     Where is the ``equilibrium point'' between the
%%   Earth and the ``closer'' Moon?
%%\item What speed would the moon need to maintain its orbit?   How quickly would the Moon orbit in its closer position?
%%\item  How would the brightness of the moon change?
% \end{itemize}
%
%Some of the questions need to be refined.  What question would you like to answer?  
%
%And what do you need to know in order to answer it?  (Some useful facts are listed on the next page.)  
%
%\newpage
Here are some useful facts for answering some of the questions posed:   
\begin{itemize}
\item Period of moon's current orbit:  27.32 days
\item Period of ISS's orbit: approximately 93 minutes
\item Radius of moon's current orbit:  $384,400 \, \rm{km}$
\item Distance to ISS: 420 km
\item Mass of moon: $7.34\times 10^{22}\, \rm{kg}$
\item Mass of earth: $5.972\times 10^{24}\, \rm{kg}$
\item Radius of moon: $1.737\times 10^3\, \rm{km}$
\item Radius of earth: $6.371\times 10^3\, \rm{km}$
\item Gravitational constant:  $G = 6.67408\times 10^{-11} \dfrac{\rm{m}^3}{ \rm{kg} \, \rm{ s}^2}$
\item Law of gravity:  $F=\dfrac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$
\item Circular acceleration: $a=\dfrac{v^2}{r}$
\end{itemize}

Suggestions:  
\begin{itemize}
\item A good picture is very useful for problem solving.  
\item Be sure to pay attention to units!
\end{itemize}

\end{problem}

\newpage

In your group, pick one of the following two problems:  

\begin{problem}
Consider the following related questions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item What speed would the moon have to be going to maintain a stable orbit? 
\item How long would it take the moon to go around the earth? 
\end{itemize}
  
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
With the moon so close, would you feel the effect of its gravity?  Consider:  
\begin{itemize}
\item When the moon is directly overhead, it will exert a gravitational force up on your body, lessening your apparent weight.  
\item When the moon is directly on the opposite side of the earth, it will exert a gravitational force down on your body, increasing your apparent weight.  
\end{itemize}
Will these weight changes be noticeable?  Do some calculations to estimate the percent changes in your weight.

%
%  Shadow of the Moon
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%In our last class we investigated how large the shadow of the Moon
%would be during a solar eclipse. One thing that makes this problem
%tricky is the sheer size of the numbers involved. Let's all agree on the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The radius of the Sun is $6.96\times 10^5$ km.
%\item The radius of the Moon is $1.74\times 10^3$ km.
%\item The distance from the Earth to the Sun is $1.52\times 10^8$
%  km.
%\end{itemize}
%
%Now consider this schematic diagram:
%\begin{image}
%  \begin{tikzpicture}
%    \coordinate (S) at (0,4);
%    \coordinate (Sn) at (0,-4);
%    \coordinate (M) at (7,2);

%    \coordinate (E) at (10,3);
%    \coordinate (En) at (10,-3);
%    \coordinate (U) at (14,0);
%    \coordinate (OS) at (0,0);
%    \coordinate (OM) at (7,0);

%    \draw[black!50!white,very thick] (Mn)--(OM);
%    \draw[very thick] (OS)--(S);
%    \draw[very thick,red] (OM)--(OE);
%    \draw[very thick] (OM)--(M);
%    \draw[very thick] (OE)--(SW);
%    \draw[very thick] (OE)--(U);
%    \node[left] at (SR) {$6.69\times 10^5$ km};
%    \node[left] at (MR) {$1.74\times 10^3$ km};
%    \node[above] at (L) {$\ell$};
%    \node[left] at (X) {$x$};
%    \node[above] at (D) {$d$};
%    \node[below] at (Sn) {Sun};
%    \node[below] at (Mn) {Moon};
%    \node[below] at (En) {Earth};
%    \node at (5,-.5) {$1.52\times 10^8$ km};
%  \end{tikzpicture}
%\end{image}
%
%
%
%From the diagram we can make the following equation (using similar triangles)
%\[
%\frac{x}{\ell} = \frac{6.96\times 10^5}{1.52\times 10^8 + \ell}.
%\]
%It turns out that $\ell$ is much, much smaller than the distance to
%the Sun. Hence, we can simplify the expression above to the
%approximate equation
%\[
%\frac{x}{\ell} = \frac{6.96\times 10^5}{1.52\times 10^8}.
%\]
%Moreover, (again using similar triangles) we see that
%\[
%\frac{x}{\ell}  = \frac{1.74\times 10^3}{d+\ell}
%\]
%where $d$ represents the distance from the Earth to the Moon.
%
%\begin{problem}
%  Using the approximate equations
%  \[
%  \frac{x}{\ell} = \frac{6.96\times 10^5}{1.52\times 10^8} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{x}{\ell}  = \frac{1.74\times 10^3}{d+\ell}
%  \]
%  solve for $x$ in terms of $d$. 
%  \[
%  x = \answer{1740} - d\cdot 0.00458\text{ km}
%  \]
%  Note, we've already typed most of the equation. For the first term, round to the nearest integer.
%\end{problem}
%
%\begin{problem}
%  At its closest, the (actual) Moon is around $3.6\times 10^5$ km from
%  the Earth.  What is the radius of the shadow of the Moon in this
%  case?
%  \[
%  x = \answer{91.2} \text{ km}
%  \]
%\end{problem}
%
%\begin{problem}
%  In our hypothetical setting where the Moon is as close as the
%  International Space Station is around $382$ km from the Earth.  What
%  is the radius of the shadow of the Moon in this case?
%  \[
%  x = \answer{1738.25} \text{ km}
%  \]
%\end{problem}
%
%
%
%\begin{problem}
%  At its furthest, the (actual) Moon is around $4.5\times 10^5$ km
%  from the Earth.  According to your equation above, what is the
%  radius of the shadow of the Moon in this case?
%  \[
%  x = \answer{-321} \text{ km}
%  \]
