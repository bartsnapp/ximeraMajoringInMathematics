%% What would the gravitational effect of this closer Moon be? Let's hear
%% some speculation!

%% We can start to figure this out with some physics and mathematics.
%% Newton's \textit{law of universal gravitation} states that the
%% magnitude of the force given by two masses is
%% \[
%% F = G \cdot \frac{m\cdot M}{r^2} 
%% \]
%% where $F$ is measured in newtons, $m$ and $M$ are in kilograms, $r$ is
%% in meters, and the constant $G$ is approximately $6.672\times
%% 10^{-11}\, \mathrm{N}\, \mathrm{m}^2/\mathrm{kg}^2$. On the other hand
%% the acceleration due to gravity on the Earth's surface is around
%% $9.8\, \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^2$, Newton's second law of motion states:
%% \[
%% F = ma
%% \]
%% where $F$ is the magnitude of the force in newtons.


%% The Moon is around...
