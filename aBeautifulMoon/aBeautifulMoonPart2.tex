From our last class, we came up with four pressing questions. Try to
answer as many of these as you can! Note, these questions were simply
copied from the board, hence they may be vague.

\begin{problem}
  If the Moon is closer, where is the ``equilibrium point'' between the
  Earth and the ``closer'' Moon?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  If the Moon is closer, how exactly does the brightness change?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  How quickly would the Moon orbit in its closer position?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  What changes in gravity would we notice?
\end{problem}
\end{document}
