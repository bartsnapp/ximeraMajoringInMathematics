When you take out a loan, the amount of the loan is called
\textbf{principal}.  For most loans, interest is calculated monthly,
based on an \textbf{annual interest rate}, and based on the remaining
balance.  When you make a payment, your payment first offsets the
accumulated interest and then is applied to principal, in order to
calculate the \textbf{remaining principal balance}.  The loan is paid
back in full when the remaining principal balance is reduced to zero.


Although loans are typically paid monthly, we first explore annual payments to simplify and shorten the calculations.  

\begin{question}[2.5in]
Suppose you borrow $\$6,000$ and agree to pay it back in \textbf{equal} annual
payments over $4$ years.  Interest is calculated at $5\%$,
compounded annually. 

Without making any complicated calculations, let's make a guess at what the annual payment should be.  

First, if the interest rate were $0\%$, the payment would need to be $\answer{6000/4}$ dollars in order to pay off the loan in 4 years.  

\begin{question}
Correct!  This can serve as a lower bound for what the annual payment will need to be.  

Before thinking about an upper bound for the annual payment, how much interest will accrue during the year 1 of the loan?  
$\answer{6000*.05}$ dollars.  

\begin{question}
Correct!  

And in subsequent years, the accrued interest will be less because the remaining principal balance will be less.  
So adding the year-1 interest to our lower-bound gives a good upper bound of $\answer{6000/4 + 6000\times.05)}$.  
 
\end{question}
\end{question}
\end{question}

\newpage
\begin{question}[1in]
We first approach this problem numerically.  Let's \textbf{split the difference} between our lower- and upper-bounds and use  
\textbf{equal} annual payments of $\answer{6000/4 + 6000\times.05/2}$ dollars.  

Complete the following table to show how this annual payment would work.  Round all answers to the nearest cent.
