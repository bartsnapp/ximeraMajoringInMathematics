\begin{question}[1in]
Suppose you borrow $\$P$ and agree to pay it back in equal annual
payments over $5$ years, with an annual interest rate of $r$, compounded annually.  

\begin{itemize}
\item Call the annual payment $x$.
\item Use the table from last week's class, showing the interest, payment, and remaining
principal at the end of years $1, 2, 3, \dots$.  
\item Collect factors of $(1+r)$ where you can.  
\item Let $P_n$ denote the principal in year $n$, with $P_0=P$, and write a recursive formula for $P_n$ in terms of $P_{n-1}$, $r$, and $x$ for $n\ge 1$.  
\end{itemize}

%\[
%\answer{P(1+r)^5-x(1+r)^4 -x(1+r)^3-x(1+r)^2 - x(1+r) -x} = 0.

\begin{question}
As a step toward a closed formula for $P_n$, write out expressions for $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$, \dots in terms of $P$, $r$, and $x$, and try to find a pattern (using dots).

\begin{question}
Some students notice that the formula above includes a geometric
series.  Which of the following are examples of geometric series?
\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice{$1+2+3+4+5+6+7$}
  \choice[correct]{$(1/2) + (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^4+(1/2)^5$}
  \choice{$3+6+9+12+15+18+21$}
  \choice[correct]{$(1+r) + (1+r)^2 + (1+r)^3 + (1+r)^4+ (1+r)^5$}
  \choice[correct]{$0.151515151515\dots$}
\end{multipleChoice}

\end{question}




\begin{question}
Find a closed-form expression for the sum of the geometric series:
  \[
  1 + (1+r) + (1+r)^2 + (1+r)^3 + \dots + (1+r)^{n-2}+ (1+r)^{n-1}
  \]
  Call the geometric series $S$, and note that if you multiply $S$ by $r$, the ``common ratio,'' you get another geometric series with many of the same terms.  Use these observations to find the sum of the series.

  \[
  S = \answer{\frac{(1+r)^n-1}{r}}
  \]

 Use the closed-form expression for the sum of the geometric series to solve your equation for $x$, the annual payment.

\begin{question}
What about monthly payments?  In other words, suppose you borrow $\$P$ and agree to pay it back in equal monthly
payments over $n$ years, with an annual interest rate of $r$, compounded monthly.  
Write a formula for the monthly payment.

\newpage 

Now let's use your formula!  

\begin{question}
Suppose that you buy a house with a $\$120,000$ mortgage, to be
paid back in equal monthly payments over $30$ years.  If the interest
rate is $6\%$, compounded monthly, what is your monthly payment? $\answer{719.46}$
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}
\vfill
\end{question}

\begin{question}
For this $\$120,000$ mortgage, how much interest and how much principal
would you pay in the first month?  

Interest: $\answer{600}$
Principal:  $\answer{119.46}$
\end{question}

\begin{question}
For the same mortgage, how much interest would you pay in total over the $30$ years?
$\answer{139005.60}$
\end{question}

\newpage

\begin{question}
Finding an equal monthly payment for paying off a debt is a foundational problem in financial mathematics.  
How might this problem change for more complicated financial transactions?  Consider the perspectives of 
borrowers, lenders, bankers, investors, etc.
