\title{Paying off Debt}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Here we investigate where your payments go when you pay off debt.

When you take out a loan, the amount of the loan is called
\textbf{principal}.  For most loans, interest is calculated monthly,
based on an \textbf{annual interest rate}, and based on the remaining
balance.  When you make a payment, your payment first offsets the
accumulated interest and then is applied to principal, in order to
calculate the \textbf{remaining principal balance}.  The loan is paid
back in full when the remaining principal balance is reduced to zero.

\begin{question}[1in]
Suppose you borrow $\$5,000$ and agree to pay it back in equal annual
payments over $5$ years.  Interest is calculated at $7\%$,
compounded annually. 

Without making any calculations, make a guess at what the annual payment should be.

\begin{question}[0in]
We will approach this problem numerically.  Use your guess to complete a table like the following.  (Do this work on paper, offline.  In Ximera, enter just the last row of your table.)

\begin{question}
Based on your table, was your guess is too low, too high, or just right?  Explain.

\begin{question}[0in]
Complete the table again for other possible payment amounts until you have found the ``best'' annual payment.  (In Ximera, enter just the last row of your table.)

\begin{question}
Using your best annual payment, how much interest would you pay in total over the $5$ years? 
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\begin{question}[.5in]
Complete the table again, this time with a beginning principal of P, an interest rate of $r$,
and a payment amount of $x$.  Hint: It helps to collect factors of $(1+r)$.

Then write an equation that must be true if $x$ is the correct
payment amount.   (In Ximera, enter just the equation.)

%Call the geometric series $S$, and note that if you multiply $S$ by $1.07$, the ``common ratio,'' you get another geometric series with many of the same terms.  Use these observations to find the sum of the series.
