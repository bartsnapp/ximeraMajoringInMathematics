\title{Paying off Debt}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Here we investigate where your payments go when you pay off debt.

\maketitle

When you take out a loan, the amount of the loan is called
\textbf{principal}.  For most loans, interest is calculated monthly,
based on an \textbf{annual interest rate}, and based on the remaining
balance.  When you make a payment, your payment first offsets the
accumulated interest and then is applied to principal, in order to
calculate the \textbf{remaining principal balance}.  The loan is paid
back in full when the remaining principal balance is reduced to zero.
\begin{question}
Suppose you borrow $\$5,000$ and agree to pay it back in equal annual
payments over $5$ years.  Interest is calculated at $7\%$,
compounded annually. 

Without making any calculations, make a guess at what the annual payment should be.  
\end{question}

\begin{question}
We will approach this problem numerically.  Use your guess to complete the following table:  

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
Year & Interest & Balance w/ Interest & Payment & Remaining Principal Balance \\ \hline
0    &          &                     &         & \$5,000                     \\ \hline
1    &          &                     &         &                             \\ \hline
2    &          &                     &         &                             \\ \hline
3    &          &                     &         &                             \\ \hline
4    &          &                     &         &                             \\ \hline
5    &          &                     &         &                             \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
What ``result'' is demonstrated by your table?

\end{question}

\begin{question}
Based on your table, was your guess is too low, too high, or just right?  Explain.  
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Complete the table again for other possible payment amounts until you have found the ``best'' annual payment.  
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Using your best annual payment, how much interest would you pay in total over the $5$ years? 
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Complete the table again for a payment amount of $x$, and write an equation that must be true if $x$ is the correct
payment amount.   
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Some students notice that the equation above includes a geometric series.  Write the geometric series here.
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
How do you know this is a series?  How do you know this is a geometric series?   
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Call the geometric series $S$, and note that if you multiply $S$ by $1.07$, the ``common ratio,'' you get another geometric series with many of the same terms.  Use these observations to find the sum of the series.

\end{question}

\begin{question}
Suppose you borrow $\$P$ and agree to pay it back in equal annual
payments over $n$ years.  If interest is calculated at $r\%$,
compounded annually, what is your annual payment, $A$?
\begin{hint}
Again, make a table showing the interest, payment, and remaining
principal at the end of years $1$, $2$, and $3$, and try to notice a
pattern in the formulas.

\begin{question}
Now suppose that you buy a house with a $\$120,000$ mortgage, to be
paid back in equal monthly payments over $30$ years.  If the interest
rate is $6\%$, compounded monthly, what is your monthly payment?
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}

\begin{question}
In the mortgage question, how much interest and how much principal
would you pay in the first month? Why?
