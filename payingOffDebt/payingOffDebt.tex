When you take out a loan, the amount of the loan is called
\textbf{principal}.  For most loans, interest is calculated monthly,
based on an \textbf{annual interest rate}, and based on the remaining
balance.  When you make a payment, your payment first offsets the
accumulated interest and then is applied to principal, in order to
calculate the \textbf{remaining principal balance}.  The loan is paid
back in full when the remaining principal balance is reduced to zero.
\begin{question}
Suppose you borrow $\$5,000$ and agree to pay it back in equal annual
payments over $5$ years.  If interest is calculated at $7\%$,
compounded annually, what is your annual payment?
\begin{hint}
How much will you owe at the end of the first year, just before you
make your payment?  Use this number to make a guess at an appropriate
annual payment.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
Using your guess, make a table showing the interest, payment, and
remaining principal at the end of each of the five years.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
How will your table show you whether your guess is too low, too high, or just right?

\begin{question}
In the previous question, how much interest would you pay in total over the $5$ years?

\begin{question}
Suppose you borrow $\$P$ and agree to pay it back in equal annual
payments over $n$ years.  If interest is calculated at $r\%$,
compounded annually, what is your annual payment, $A$?
\begin{hint}
Again, make a table showing the interest, payment, and remaining
principal at the end of years $1$, $2$, and $3$, and try to notice a
pattern in the formulas.

\begin{question}
Now suppose that you buy a house with a $\$120,000$ mortgage, to be
paid back in equal monthly payments over $30$ years.  If the interest
rate is $6\%$, compounded monthly, what is your monthly payment?

In the mortgage question, how much interest and how much principal
would you pay in the first month? Why?
