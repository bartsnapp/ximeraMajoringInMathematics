\title{Sums and products combined, oh my!}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Here we investigate a new way to combine numbers.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Suppose you wrote the numbers $1,2,3,\dots,100$ on a chalkboard. You
may take any two numbers, erase them, and then add the sum of their
sum and their product to the list.

\begin{problem}
In class we came up with several questions involing this setting. State three of them.

\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  With this setting, we made up a new operation $\pt$ where
  \[
  a\pt b = a+b + ab
  \]
  What is
  \[
  a\pt b\pt c = \answer{a+b+c+ab+ac+bc+abc}
  \]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
We showed that $\pt$ is \textbf{commutative}, which means
\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice[correct]{$a\pt b = b\pt a$}
  \choice{$((a\pt b)\pt c) = a(\pt (b\pt c))$}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
We showed that $\pt$ is \textbf{associative}, which means
\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice{$a\pt b = b\pt a$}
  \choice[correct]{$((a\pt b)\pt c) = a(\pt (b\pt c))$}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Finally we encoutered several squences of numbers including
\begin{align*}
  &\{ 1, 3, 7, 15, 63,\dots\}\\
  &\{ 2, 4, 8, 16, 64,\dots\}\\
  &\{ 1, 5, 23, 119, 719,\dots\}\\
  &\{ 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,\dots\}
\end{align*}
Look these sequences up at \link{https://oeis.org/}{https://oeis.org/}. Find something intersting at the OEIS and tell us about it.

See you next Tuesday!
