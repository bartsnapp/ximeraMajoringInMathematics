\begin{question}
Which is better?  Explain. 
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$\sqrt{9} = \pm 3$.} 
\choice[correct]{$\sqrt{9} = 3$.}
\choice{Either one is fine.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{question}
Although it is true that both $3$ and $-3$ are ``square roots'' of $9$, the convention is that $\sqrt{9}=3$, so that the notation is unambiguous.  

When $a>0$, the notation $\sqrt{a}$ means the \emph{principal} square root of $a$, which is to say the positive one.  If $a<0$ or if $a$ is a non-real complex number, then the notation is less clear.

What do "convention" and "unambiguous" mean in the first paragraph? 
\end{question}

\end{question}



\begin{question}
Any complex number $z$ can be written $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i^{2}=-1$.  Its complex conjugate, $\overline{z}=a-bi$.   (Read ``z bar.'')

Do complex numbers include the real numbers?  
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Yes.}
\choice{No.}
\choice{It depends.}
\end{multipleChoice}
Explain. 
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}

\begin{question}
A complex number $a+bi$ is real when $b=0$, so the complex numbers include the real numbers. A complex number is real exactly when $z=\overline{z}$. 

Some people use the phrase imaginary number to indicate a non-real complex number (i.e., $b\ne0$).  A complex number $a+bi$ is often called a pure imaginary number if $a=0$ and $b\ne0$.  

\end{question}
\end{question}

\begin{question}

If we identify the complex number $a+bi$ with the ordered pair $(a,b)$, we can plot complex numbers as points (or vectors) on the complex plane.  The horizontal axis is call the real axis, abbreviated Re($z$); the vertical axis is called the imaginary axis, abbreviated Im($z$).

How do we find the magnitude of a complex number?  

\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}

\begin{question}
The magnitude of a complex number is its distance from origin:  $\|z\| =\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}$.  It's also the length of the vector.  
\end{question}

\end{question}

\begin{question}

Suppose we let $r=\|z\| $, think of $z$ as a vector, and let $\theta$ denote the angle that vector makes with the positive real axis, then the complex number can be located with polar coordinates$\left(r;\theta\right)$.  (Some texts use a semicolon to distinguish polar coordinates from rectangular coordinates.)

\begin{center}

\end{center}

Write equations relating the rectangular coordinates $\left(a,b\right)$ and the polar coordinates.  
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}

\begin{question}
Yes, if a complex number has polar coordinates$\left(r;\theta\right)$and rectangular coordinates$\left(a,b\right),$ then $a=r\cos\theta$, $b=r\sin\theta$, $r^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}$, and $\tan\theta=\frac{b}{a}$.  Practice converting between rectangular and polar coordinates.   
\end{question}
\end{question}

\begin{question}

Compute $z\overline{z}$.  What do you notice? 

Note: For $\overline{z}$, type \verb|\bar{z}| in text mode, select it, and press math mode.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Yes, $z\overline{z}=\left(a+bi\right)\left(a-bi\right)=a^{2}+b^{2}=\|z\| ^{2}$.

What happens if $z$ is a real number? 
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}

\end{question}

\begin{question}
Yes, if $z$ is real, $b=0$, so $\|z\| =\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}=\sqrt{a^{2}}=\left|a\right|$.  For this reason, some texts use absolute value symbols (rather than double bars) to indicate magnitudes of complex numbers.  

It is tempting to simplify as follows:$\sqrt{a^{2}}=a$.  What might you do to avoid this error?

\begin{question}
Think about adding $2+3i$ to every number in the complex plane.  How would that transform the plane?  Can you generalize to adding or subtracting any complex number?

\begin{question}
Think about multiplying every number in the complex plane by 3.  How would that transform the plane?  

Hint: Try it for a few specific complex numbers.  Then generalize.

\begin{question}
Think about multiplying every number in the complex plane by $-1$.  How would that transform the plane?  

Hint: Try it for a few specific complex numbers.  Then generalize.

\end{question}

\begin{question}
Think about multiplying every number in the complex plane by $i$.  How would that transform the plane?

\begin{question}
Explore the geometry of complex multiplication. In the diagram, $v$ and $w$ are complex numbers, and $w=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Build the product by considering the real and imaginary parts of $w$ separately.

Why is $av$ as shown? Why is $biv$ as shown? Why is $wv$ as shown?

\begin{freeResponse}
The vector $av$ scales $v$ by the real number $a$, which appears to be greater than $1$ in this case. 

The vector $biv$ appears twice in the diagram, and the two are congruent.  

The vector $biv$ from the origin is a $90^\circ$ rotation of $v$, scaled by the real number $b$, with $0<b<1$ in this case.  

The other vector $biv$ is positioned to illustrate similar triangles. 

\end{freeResponse}


Look for similar triangles. Why are they similar? What is the scale factor?
\begin{freeResponse}
The triangle with sides $av$, $biv$ and $wv$ is similar to the triangle with sides $a$, $bi$, and $w$.  They are similar by SAS similarity, with the common right angles and scale factor $\| v\|$. 
\end{freeResponse}


How does the angle of the product $wv$ relate to the angles of $w$ and of $v$? Explain.
\begin{freeResponse}
The angle of $wv$ is the sum of the angles of $w$ and of $v$.  The angle of $wv$ is formed by adjacent angles from $v$ and from the similar triangle.  
\end{freeResponse}


How does the magnitude of the product $wv$ relate to the magnitudes of $w$ and $v$? Explain.
\begin{freeResponse}
The magnitude of the product is the product of the magnitudes:  $\| wv\|=\| w\| \| v\|$.  This follows because previously mentioned similar triangles with scale factor $\| v\|$.  
\end{freeResponse}

Summary of the results:  When multiplying complex numbers: multiply their magnitudes and add their angles.
